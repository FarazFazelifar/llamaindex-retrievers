    "# Reciprocal Retriever\n",
    "By combining the results from multiple retrievers, this retriever aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. It employs reciprocal rank fusion, a technique that prioritizes results that consistently rank highly across different retrievers, ensuring that the most relevant information is presented to the user.\n",

    "- Prioritization of Consistent Results: By combining multiple retrievers and using reciprocal rank fusion, this method emphasizes results that consistently rank high across different approaches, potentially improving reliability.\n",
